DemoCodesOutex.m	shows the basic operations of LBPV_GM. please download Outex Database from http://www.outex.oulu.fi first and then extract the Outex_TC_00010 database to the correct folder. 

ClassifyOnNN.m 		computes the classification accuracy
ConvertU2LBP.m 		converts the uniform LBP(LBPV) histogram sequence to meet the requirement for Global Matching
distGMES.m 		computes the dissimilarity between training samples and test by Exhaustive Searching
distGMPD.m 		computes the dissimilarity between training samples and test samples by Principal Direction(s)
distGMPDRN.m 		computes the dissimilarity between training samples and test samples by Principal Direction(s) and proposed feature reduction
distMATChiSquare.m 	computes the dissimilarity between training samples and a test sample
LBPV.m 			returns LBPV histogram of an image
ReadOutexTxt.m		gets picture IDs and class IDs from txt for Outex Database
